OffiStation is a simple and clean mini e-commerce website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features organized product categories for office supplies and stationery, along with an interactive add-to-cart function. The design was first drafted in Canva and then developed into a functional web prototype.

This project showcases our teamwork, creativity, and growing skills in front-end web development as BS Office Administration students.
